I read that collagen is mostly for moisturizing when applied topically so I�m not upset when I�m not seeing a ton of plumping effect (honestly I don�t believe anything that�s applied on the skin�s surface can plump lol), but man this thing nourishes the skin well. I was getting a ton of pimples along my jawline and it pretty much has stopped ever since I started using this.

I have cool and smooth lips when I�m consistently using this product. BUT, the other reviews are accurate the wax-like yellow balls get stuck in the hole and you squeeze then POoooo too much product pops out no matter the pressure. it�s a game to get the right amount. Also, this is not a typical balm or gloss, remember it�s a lip treatment. i think of it like a lip serum like hyaluronic acid serum for your face feels.... ahhh I can�t think of the right word for it. It leaves a very light coating on my lips. I love that it has a long lasting cooling feeling. There is a taste/scent/flavor that I�m not a fan of. it�s light enough to ignore and don�t lick your lips.

At first I used too much of the product and have since found I need only use a rather small amount to work into my skin. I do not wear a lot of make up but am guessing this melting cleanser is very good at dissolving make up and impurities of the day. I gave it 4 stars because the texture is a little too heavy for my personal opinion. It is very rich, a little thick, but does dissolve with application and glides over the skin smoothly. I rinse it off using water and a washcloth to remove the last traces of cleanser. The post-cleansing results are the reward: skin looks and feels clean and nourished, which I believe would describe the �anti-aging� aspect of the product. It is gentle, but thorough.

This serum does what a Vitamin C serum should but isn�t more powerful than others out there, so I don�t know why it�s so much more expensive. I find Algenist products to be really gentle (but effective) so if you have sensitive skin and looking for a Vitamin C that doesn�t irritate give this a try.

Now I�m back at Sephora for my refresh of the product. I weaned myself off the AA after I ran out, and made myself change back to my SC HA intensifier I used to claim as my HG product. The first morning after not using I could tell a difference; my skin was full and looked ruddy like I needed some hydration and exfoliating. I use my HA at night in combination with tretinoin so I should never feel like I wake up and don�t shine. I�m terribly cheap and won�t waste $1. I bought it and I�m using it even if it�s terrible, then when it�s gone I won�t buy it again. So that�s what I did with my last bottle of SC I mustered through.

In addition, it has helped tremendously with the maskne I�ve been experiencing. In fact, it has disappeared completely over the past 3 weeks of use and I wear a mask for 8+ hours a day for my job.

But I felt like I had to leave one for this because I would literally have a near panic attack if they ever stopped making it. It�s hands down the best neck cream I�ve ever used and I�ve tried several high end brands since I entered my 40s. It feels luxurious and soothing when applied. It�s especially helpful right now post chin lipo 2 weeks ago.I like to use a facial spray (like Evian or Caudalie very lightly just prior to use to seal in the moisture of this cream twice daily). It�s incredibly moisturizing and has a very light and clean fragrance (I�m very sensitive to fragrance normally and a lot of neck creams smell way too strong unfortunately). The scent doesn�t stick around because it�s so light which is also nice for others that are sensitive too. It�s definitely a holy grail product for me and I started to notice great improvement in the softness and some firmness after several days of consistent use AM & PM (I�ve been using it for over a year now though and will never go without it). I also love applying to my chest, it�s made great changes there as well. Can�t say enough about how much youth, elasticity (and even clarity on my chest) has improved. However, don�t expect a miracle for firmness.

Then I heard one of the Kardashian sisters talking about it as well. Now I�m not a celebrity crazy person. I understand they are paid to say these things but still I was curious. Bobbi Brown has her own skin care line so for her to unofficially endorse another brand says a lot. But then I saw the price and I was like �uh, that�s okay.�Then 4 months ago I got a sample from Sephora for an order I had placed. I figured it�s free-what�s the worst that can happen. Full discloser I�ve been using Lancome�s Genefique for about 20 years-and I swear by this stuff. I also use SKII�s essence and their night cream-religiously.I will say this product with one use makes my face look like I just had an oxygen facial. If you want to experiment then try this-just use the A.B. The Rich Cream around your eyes only. (Our eyes are the first place where aging starts-around the age of 24-25 years old) This way you have something to compare it to. Now the sample last me about 3 months-I used it every day. So for those who are on the fence because of the steep price-the stuff goes a long way and it�s super concentrated. You only need a tiny bit of it. The pores about my T-zone have shrunk to almost normal size. (I have large pores around my nose from teenage acne. I�ve tried everything to shrink it from laser therapy to prescription Retinol. Nothing seem to quite work) The Rich Cream also has minimize the scars from my nose from surgery I had 2 years ago and the fine lines around my eyes has gotten softer. I now only use the A.B. system. It�s pricy but think of all the hundreds of dollars we all have thrown away trying out products that seem to work for a while or never worked as advertise. I know I have a drawer full of them.

I (personally) found these to be far superior to the other ones I�ve tried- and they didn�t irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes.

Immediately there is a noticeable glow to my skin which I love, however I�m not so keen on the powder consistency - it�s so fine that when you tear open the top of the sachet and pour into your palm, some of it disperses into the air, so best to hold away from you.

The packaging of this product is perfect. It pumps out exactly the amount you need every time. One bottle for me lasted almost two years which did make me feel better about the price. I bought this for the first time I think sometime in September of 2020 and I just ran out of it now. Once it stoped dispensing the product,  I did force it open because I wanted to see if there was any more left I could get to. I was shocked to find that the contraption inside was very thoughtful and well thought out for the consumer to make sure that almost every drop was dispensed and hardly waisted! Again I found this extremely thoughtful from the company who definitely put a lot of thought behind the design of not only the product, but also the packaging for the consumer. For the price I paid there was barely any wasted product. I like that it�s easy to travel with since it twists to dispense. The smell is very calming and I find I look forward to putting it on to smell the wonderful aroma before I go to bed. Makes me feel relaxed and less stressed ready for bed. Towards the end I started to even put the product on my hands that�s how much I liked the smell and the moisture effect it gave me. Wish they made a buddy lotion for this. Although, with the price of the face cream not sure if I could afford their body lotion if they would made it. However I do think that not everyone would like the smell but again for me loved it! The price I can also see deterring people from wanting to try it or be purchasing it again . But I will be a repeated customer since not only dose it work for me and me needs, but the product lasted a very long time, and the packaging was so extremely thoughtful that I don�t feel as if I�m wasting money when I do repurchase it.

This product works like a dream to even out my skin tone and calm down the splotchiness and redness � fast. On top of that, it�s the slightest bit pearlescent, so your skin looks dewy and radiant. Also, I LOVE the ever-so-delicate herbal scent (fresh sage?). No issues with breakouts either; while my skin is generally clear, I�m prone to cystic zits if I use irritating products. This doesn�t irritate my skin at all. From Day 1. No adjustment necessary.I do wish that this serum did more than just soothe redness � ingredients to help with visible pores and fine lines would  be splendid � but let�s face it, most serums are only meant to do one thing.

P447789,Sun Drops SPF 50,6302,Dr. Barbara Sturm,3538,150,Skincare,Sunscreen,4,1,"I used this spf for about a year along with a full Dr. Sturm skincare routine. It was effective, and I learned there is a knack to applying it to avoiding the pilling noted by other reviewers: your skin needs to be really hydrated. I found that when my skin was on the drier side, sun drops were really hard to apply. The product pilled and just wouldn�t sink in. But when my skin was hydrated and supple, it sunk right in and meshed beautifully with my skincare and under makeup. On the one hand, I liked realizing how much more hydrated my skin needed to be�on the other, our skin goes through phases and we doing want something as important and routine as our daily spf to be difficult to apply. Another trick when it did pill (which is something I do for any product that won�t sink in Shaun) is to spray a facial mist over the skin and then massage everything in. Works every time! There�s that hydration factor again I guess. Lastly: be aware that the regulations surrounding skincare filters are different in the US than in Europe, and the formulation for this spf is different here in the states. Sturm products are made in Germany, and my guess is they haven�t just perfected the formula for the US version. In summary, if your skin is generally well hydrated and especially if you have a Sturm routine, I think these drops are great because they can blend so beautifully and look very dewy on the skin. But there are so many amazing spf�s these days where you may get more bang for your buck.

I�ll say firstly that I am in my early 30s and don�t have a lot of fine lines or wrinkles yet but preventative care is the best care. This eye cream has a relatively low concentration of retinol and is quite gentle. I have heard that retinol can be drying to the skin but because it�s a lower concentration, in combination with moisturizing ingredients, I have not had any issues adding it to my routine. Dr Brandt also claims this product has �a unique ruby crystal complex� which brightens and illuminates. I�ll be honest, I only use this at night so that addition to the formula is largely unnecessary to me. Retinol can make skin more sensitive to the sun so I prefer to use a different eye cream in the morning. I really like the packaging of this eye cream, it�s a sleek pump bottle. The pump dispenses a good amount and I like that it�s airtight to keep the product fresh and sanitary.

I�m mid-60s and have slightly oily skin, with life-long stubborn little blackheads and whiteheads in my T-zone.  I�m accustomed to using peels and my skin can handle the extra-strength versions.  Prior to using this one, I was using the Dr. Gross extra-strength peel daily for a couple of years.   I honestly didn�t know if this stronger peel would have any further effect on my skin.  However, after only the first try, my skin already looked somehow �pinker;� that is, the �freckles� (actually multiple sun spots) all over my cheeks had a diminished appearance.  I�ve been using it three times per week, and so far, the results are amazing.  I figured I�d have those stubborn sun spots the rest of my life.  They are the result of lots of teen-age sun damage.  However, they are starting to disappear.  It seems like a miracle to me.  My skin looks smooth, radiant, and more even-toned.  I am fair with a neutral-pink tone, and my tone has become more pink and dewy looking.  I�m actually getting the skin I�ve dreamed of my entire adult life.  I don�t like wearing lots of makeup, but to conceal my sun spots, I�ve always had to wear some type of foundation.  I am now using this peel 3X per week and the regular, extra-strength daily peel the other 4X per week.  With the results I�m getting from this regimen, my skin is looking so good that I have started leaving off the foundation.  Just a little powder and blush and I�m good to go.  Often I only use a primer and no makeup at all.  My skin is glowing and I have a new confidence in my appearance.  My stubborn blackheads and whiteheads are starting to disappear.  I am so jazzed about my skin, I can�t wait to get up in the morning and see how good it looks.  I cannot recommend this stuff enough.  Dr. Gross skincare really WORKS.

I did find that the rubber mask kept sliding down my face though so I ended up having to lay down and once I finally took the mask off I could see a thick layer of ampoule sitting on my skin so it seemed like nothing absorbed into my skin.

Sure, it�s less tidy on your counter and while travelling, but I�ll take that over any of the skin issues I was having. And I love the silky slippery way it lathers and moves across the face.

The first was as a blush on my bare cheeks, the second was as Drunk Elephant promotes: a drop mixed in with your moisturizer and spread over your face. Neither of these things did anything notable for me. As a medium/olive skin tone girl who doesn�t want to tan or look darker, it gave me the appearance of looking such and didn�t show up as blush or face brightening. I then tried it as a blush topper- on top of my cheekbones parallel to the beginning of my pupils up to the ends of my eyes and along my nose after applying powder blush. It looks absolutely amazing this way. It gives my regular blush extra dimension and my skin a burst of freshness that surprisingly doesn�t look like makeup. The effect is something different from highlighter, more like I just look fresher. I use pink/peach blush, so it blends perfectly. This method also doesn�t make my skin tone look darker. It lasts the whole day on my skin and you need only a dot.

P480300,Faceshot Electric Microneedling Device + Vitamin Ampoules,6329,FaceGym,5049,275,Skincare,Value & Gift Sets,5,1,"I�m going to give it to you straight in this review as a big skincare enthusiast who wants you to buy the right products for YOU.I am a huge believer in microneedling, but with stipulations (that this device meets, more on that later). However I don�t think it is something every last person needs. Microneedling the right way is a pricey treatment, and it is for: *hyperpigmentation*. It has anti aging benefits, but so does LED (one time cost via home devices.) It�s the wrong system entirely for acne (go with benzoyl peroxide/retinoids). But for stubborn scars and/or age spots - nothing beats microneedling. Nothing.Here�s the deal with this device: they did it right. Dermarollers are an unsafe system; proper microneedling involves disposable needles.As such, this system is more pricey. Far less pricey than in-office ($20/treatment after the initial purchase), but still an investment. FaceGym also threw me a curveball with the vibration aspect. At first I went �but why?� However, as someone who has used more standard microneedling-I quickly discovered that this aspect makes for a far more enjoyable experience. I expected more pain for no more gain, but I appreciate the vibrations now that I�ve used it. It helped me get into the groove better so to speak.As for the liquid aspect. Tbh it could work better. It�s a little tricky to get it to come out evenly, and there�s always liquid left behind. This aspect could be improved, although I get the principle of widening channels within your skin for greater absorption. Nice idea, execution is 4 stars. In complete fairness, this is true with every similar device I�ve tried.Does it lead to results? Yes. Overnight, I see improved radiance - every single time. In several years of microneedling, I can personally attest to the reduction in hyperpigmentation.My tip is: use this once weekly, thoroughly treating your skin. More than that isn�t really necessary IMHO. $80 a month, and the results WILL be worth it",Experienced microneedler's opinion,light,hazel,combination,blonde

I haven�t been wearing much makeup during the past year with COVID so the TH cleanser was great, however, I found that since I�m wearing makeup daily now it doesn�t clean my skin well enough so I gave this a try. I have also been using the G.Tox toner, and since that works so well for me I thought I�d give this product a try as it also has the same active ingredients (Malachite and Fruit Acid). I absolutely love this, I won�t be going back to my TH cleanser, it cleared up the small bumps that I have due to clogged pores from wearing makeup and does not dry out my skin despite it being a foaming cleanser. I highly recommend this for people with normal/combo/oily skin, it might be too drying for dry skin types, but a little goes a long way, so I think it should be fine if you stick to one pump.

After 5 months of use (on my 2nd bottle now), here is why it checks every single one of my boxes:1. Doesn�t make me break out. I had cystic adult acne for the past few years which is now mostly cleared up and has only continued to get better while using this product. I have even fallen asleep with it on many times, which would cause breakouts with every other sunscreen I�ve used, but not this one.2. Doesn�t make me oily or dry. I have combination skin and this gives me the perfect dewy, glowy finish. If you have dry skin, you will adore the texture. If you prefer a matte finish, this isn�t it.3. Doesn�t weigh down my skin. Unlike most sunscreens that are a thick paste that you can feel just sitting on your face all day and can�t wait to take it off at night. This is so lightweight, it is like a silky water and I actually enjoy the way it feels on my skin.4. Doesn�t make my eyes burn at all. I have worn it swimming, working out, on the beach - and zero issues whatsoever5. No pilling. Every skincare and makeup product I have tried so far applies even better than normal when combined with this. 6. No white cast. The product itself is white, but immediately blends in and disappears once applied (I have light/medium olive skin tone)7. Little to no scent8. No silicone9. Beautiful packaging that dispenses the product cleanly and easily. Hasn�t leaked once and I�ve flown with it multiple times (keep the little cap that comes on the pump!)10. Has noticeably improved the overall texture and appearance of my skin - more so than any other retinol, serum, or treatment I�ve tried (much less an SPF!)

Lastly, I really appreciate that Vitamin C is included in this supplement and that I do not need to take something additionally.

P395417,Touch Home Permanent Hair Removal Device,7017,iluminage,14204,449,Skincare,High Tech Tools,5,1,"I�ve had this for 4 years and just wanted to update my review. First of all, when you purchase realize this is to REDUCE hair - this is not sold as a permanent hair machine. So in time you will have hair growing back. This will take time to show it�s full result. I followed the initial treatment on my legs of once a week for 7 weeks. For reference I�m of tan-dark complexion tone, my hair grows back the same day after shaving (fast hair growth throughout) and I have coarse, dark hair. I went from shaving my legs daily to maybe shaving once every few months (shaving stragglers hairs) otherwise I�m hairless and this has been 4 years out without doing touch up treatments. My wax lady (for bikini area) assumed she did a good job waxing on me when in reality I had been lasering between appointments. I went from seeing her every 3 weeks to 2 months. Your hair has different growth cycles so definitely continue beyond the initial 7 week treatment. At very minimal try once a month ongoing, it is a commitment. Wax prior to lasering to get optimal results and help penetrate into the folical better or shave, but laser on DRY skin. Follow the instructions. I exfoliate my skin while in the shower, avoid any lotion and get to lasering. At times I go over the same area 2-3x making the process daunting but well worth it. Some areas are more stubborn (facial, bikini and underarm) in my opinion. Just remember hair growth cycles, your hair will grow in different phases so you�ll experience patches or areas that seem resistant. The machine itself has a wide head which is better than other laser machines as you can do the process a lot quicker. The sensation is minimal to none, it�s emitting heat so the area I feel it most is the bikini area so I normally bring it down to level 2 and I�m fine.

However, this product was not, in my opinion, at the same quality grade as their other products. After having finished my bottle and used this numerous times, I would estimate that on average my tan seemed to last about ~2-3 days longer than it would otherwise. A pro: when using this product, your tan fades in a more natural/gradual manner as opposed to a more splotchy/sudden fade. That said, while I do believe the product works, I expected it to preserve my tan longer (~4-5 days). With this in mind, I definitely don�t believe the product is necessary, however, if you have the extra money and need a few extra days out of your tan for a trip or just want a more natural fade - I don�t see the harm in giving it a try.",+2-3 Days & More Natural Fading,lightMedium,Grey,combination,blonde

The next day I noticed a couple spots that I missed with the body butter. I used this alone in those spots and did absolutely nothing lol I�m not sure if it�s skin tone dependent, I�m medium/light tone for reference.The description of the product makes it seem like you can just swipe it on for color, I def didn�t experience this using it solo.

So it does indeed work! I got off some color I didn�t even know was on there and now have a completely blank canvas for a new tan. I�m honestly not sure why this product has such low reviews because I find it to work really well. Maybe not everyone is following the instructions?

It doesn�t transfer on clothes, it�s long lasting in heat & humidity and it gives the skin such a subtle glow. It�s a gel texture and dries down fairly quickly so I�d recommend applying it in sections at a time. Definitely try and wash your hands ASAP, your hands will be quite bronzy if you don�t. There is a bit of a glitter in the gel but it�s very subtle. Also this wash off tan is very sheer, it�s not meant to give a deep tan.

Even living in a tropical place, I suffer from very dry skin all over my body.  I used to use this cleanser but ditched it for cheaper alternatives.  Man, was THAT a mistake.  I think the scent is heavenly -- just a light, citrus smell that I look forward to whenever I wash my face.  How many products can you say that about?  It is thick but it�s also activated by water so I squeeze 1-2 pumps in my hand, add 1-2 pumps of water and the formula is perfect to cleanse my skin.  AND, it feels so luxurious to cleanse with, like a pillow on my face.  I see some reviews that lament that�s it�s too thick for a makeup remover.  THIS IS NOT A MAKEUP REMOVER, no matter what some people say.  It�s a facial cleanser.  So, I often use a thick makeup remover like Pond�s (which I still love after all this time), then the Argan Cleansing Oil to wash, then my micellar water to remove all last remnants of makeup.  Does it breakup makeup making it easier to remove?  YES!  But it�s not micellar water.  It�s meant to be a thick, luxurious cleanser for those of us who have dry skin.

If you wear makeup you should be double cleansing, even just using a cleanser once isn�t enough. You also have to shake the bottle before using it and i use about two-three pumps for a full face of makeup. Again it is made to break up makeup not completely remove it, and the film that is on your skin is meant to be washed off with another cleanser. It is a very gentle formula which i love.

I used Sephora points to get several sample kits.  And immediately fell in love with the brand again.  It led me to dial in the appropriate products.

It keeps me hydrated during the day.  It works well with other products that I use� some times I use a primer, but often just foundation, etc.  This goes a long, long ways. I use one pump in the AM.

I have normal medium deep skin. I don�t need much to cleanse and moisturize. As matter of fact, my routine usually consists of makeup wipes with primer/moisturizer in them (yes there are some of us out here that do great with makeup wipes). I then spray one of the three MB facial sprays that I already loved and have used for years now it works as perfectly as a little moisturizer and primer for my makeup. If I go a little over board, my skin lets me know right away with a couple of small white heads.  I didn�t think it could get any better and have been pretty happy with my routine. But this spray took it to another level that I didn�t even know was possible. My skin lovessss it.  Not sure how to really explain it, my already normal plump skin looks even healthier and plumper in a good way.  I also use the hyaluronic dew drops right before the spray (received both as a gift with purchase btw) and it�s like a 1-2 punch.  Somehow it�s not overly moisturizing while being very effective in overall appearance and feel. I also use it as a setting spray after makeup because why not.  I would recommend any skin type to at least try this spray, even the oily girls cause it gives you that plump moisturized look without being a heavy added moisturizer (if that makes sense).

I usually use these with some face oil as the final step of my morning routine. I start with the de-puffing roller from the center of my face to the periphery and then change the roller and use the textured one for my neck and shoulders.

Here�s the deal though for very dry skinned gals like myself- this does not work as a moisturizer and sunscreen. I always use a moisturizer first and then this on top.  When first applied, please note that it goes on as more of a satin finish, then becomes a little wet looking, then it dries down to a beautiful soft glowy satin again.  So I like to put on my foundation (Est�e Lauder double wear) while it�s in the �wet� stage so it goes on more sheer and smooth. Both dry down to perfection.

I bought this to try out as an anti-aging/hydrating cream as I don�t care about dark circles. I�ve used for about 6 months, both morning and night. For a while, I was doing one eye with this and the other with the Biossance eye cream to see if there was a notificable difference but gave that up after about 2-3 months Zheng I ran out of the Biossance. I didn�t notice any difference between the 2.Pros: my under eye circles have lightened considerably, the cream feels light, smells lightly citrusy but isn�t heavily fragranced and doesn�t make my eyes water and burn. More accessible price point. A little spreads easily over both eyes and I like the custardy texture.Cons: I really didn�t see any anti-aging. The very very fine lines that I was trying to smooth out instead became fine lines. It�s a natural product of aging, so I didn�t blame the cream but the cream didn�t stop anything. My dark circles are pretty much gone looking straight at you but if my face is at an angle, it looks like I have dark shadowy bruises under my eyes. It took nearly half the jar before the brightness change was enough to notice. You do have to stick with it. I recommend getting a sample first to see if you have any negative reaction, especially with all these new reviews, before buying a full tub, which you may need to go through to see results. Overall: if you want a brightening eye cream, she�s your girl. I�ve bought 2x but probably won�t purchase again as I continue to search for something anti aging.",It does what it says i.e. brightens,mediumTan,hazel,dry,brown

I do have to say however that I have not messed with the retinol much. I used it once and it made me breakout and I am not very confident with using it.

I bought it the same day, had same day delivery, within minutes applied it to my face, let it set, then massaged the circles and WOW. My skin is no longer flaky. It�s soft and clean and it�s as if it took all the stress off my face. What a transformation. The enzymes work to loosen the bonds between the dead skin cells and the healthy fresh ones and the gommage gel grabs on to those dead skin cells and rolls them off.  The word gommage means �to erase� in French. It erased my flaky craggy old skin. I feel 35 again and I no longer want to hide! Thank you, PeterThomasRoth!",The transformer.,fairLight,blue,dry,auburn

If so, like me, high anxkety when washing face at sink, being too rough with my face cause i think i didn�t get all the soap off, wearing my hair up super tight, making a mess in the bathroom, water all over� we�ll say no more, or at least less of a mess with this lifesaver of a device!!! I�m legit so happy I bought this, and got it on sale!! This product is my lifesaver and probs one of the best things i ever bought. It helps me so much with my anxiety when washing my face at the sink, I used it tonight like not even an hour ago, used it with Origins Frothy Face Wash (Great combo!!!) and it works so well, lathers amazing with this device, it�s gentle, you can pick your speed (there�s 4 rhythms/speeds), i used 3 different speeds, and there�s also a backside to this device which is like a mirror kinda (i initially didn�t know what it was when i first used it and was rough with my face) but tonight 2nd time using this device at the sink was the best for me, i�ve used it 3 times so far, 2x sink, 1x shower, it�s waterproof. anyways, the backside of it warms up and is nice to put on the face and helps to see if you still have cleanser residue on your face, so that�s a bonus. Overall, I love this product and it helps me with my anxiety washing face at the sink, as i�m less rough, not rough with my face (cause i�m not using a cloth that i would rip my skin with :/). Love the color blue/teal, and the bristles on it are silicone so it�s not like a brush that hurts. I�m in love!!

This is the closest one can get I feel to a professional microdermabrasion which costs about $150-$250 anyway.

Definitely start off on the gray you will be surprised how effective this is at removing dead skin while polishing the skin. I will say be cautious when using and follow directions. You risk giving yourself abrasions and irritated skin if you are not thorough with following directions.

Only thing is you need to really PUSH the charging cable down to charge it, so put some elbow grease when you�re getting ready to charge it. It�s got 2 continuous vibration settings and also 2 pounding vibration settings. The second setting to both is just a more intense version of the one before it. The stone side also heats up.

Texture wise it�s super rich and sinks in nicely without leaving an oily finish. For such a thick cream it seems to have more of a matte finish.

However, This deserves its flowers that it also is! I have sometimes sensitive, combo-skin that is exposed to drying chemical exfoliation. So I need something that will balance oil production w/o being too heavy to clog or too superficial that it will not actually absorb. It�s the reason I�m into gels/liquids more than creams. After looking through products, I bought this as it seemed to have a lot more pros and it surely does. It is simple, vegan, non-essential oil, non-irritant working with the acids I use, fine-misted, non-greasy/sticky, with no artificial fragrance. All packaged in a dark glass container, which is best to avoid rapid degradation and better for the environment when disposing. Most importantly, this jasmine mist has the ability to absorb into the skin to quench it rather than sit on top. Very soothing and the jasmine scent is not bothersome to me. I�m not a fan of jasmine scents sometimes, however, this one is natural and disappears shortly after misting!I keep it in my fridge to preserve, since it�s a more natural product composed of jasmine essence. 4 mists after the shower, when my face dries, is what I do even though 2 is really only needed but it feels great applying on the skin. Even topping up throughout the day is refreshing. My face doesn�t feel tight or sticky and my skin doesn�t over-produce oil to compensate for the lack of true moisture, usually the result from other products. Also, I haven�t broken out after incorporating this into my routine. I use it before all other skincare, my goat Ordinary Niacinamide serum, Glycolic Toner, sometimes AHA mask.

My skin was perpetually dry and nothing was penetrating deep enough to do anything along with addressing how eczema folks have a damaged skin barrier that makes it really hard for our skin to retain moisture.

I�m on my 8th jar at this point, that�s how much I love this balm. I actually put it on several times a day due to how dry my skin is which is also why I�ve used so many balms but if you just have a small dry, stubborn patch, the jar will go a long way. Wasn�t the case for me since I used this for my whole face lolWhen you use this product, you can see the difference literally the next day. For me, I saw it within HOURS.

After layering it over my Est�e Lauder Advanced Night Repair serum, and following it with a couple drops of Saint Jane�s Luxury Serum Calming Treatment, I woke up with such gorgeous and glowing skin that I went back for a bottle the next day! I�m a longtime user of Drunk Elephant�s Protini, which will always have a place in my skincare arsenal, but Saint Jane�s formula is so luxe from packaging to application and, dare I say, feels more deeply moisturizing on my skin.

I�ve been using it for a few years now and I�m just as thrilled with it now as I was when I started. First, you use a pearl-sized amount which lathers up rich and REALLY cleans and refreshes your skin. Once it�s well rinsed and I�ve dried my skin, my skin looks bright and radiant. It�s improved my complexion in both the even tone and radiance of my skin and has eliminated my occasional pimples. My skin has improved so much that at 41 I wear sheerer foundation less frequently than I did at 35 and my skin looks just as nice. One aspect I LOVE about this product is that it removes everything really gently. I can have a full face of makeup, (including eye makeup), and at the end of the day, simply wash my face and it gets my makeup and the day�s oil and crud off of my face. It leaves it perfect. I am so surprised by the reviews that say it strips their skin and is over-drying. I have normal skin, somewhat sensitive and all I can say is that the scent is subtle, the formula is non-irritating even to remove eye makeup, (though be gentle), and following i up with a moisturizer is all I need. This is coming from someone who had skin problems all of her life. And it�s not that I�ve grown out of it as i learned when I forgot to pack this cleanser in vacation. I bought some other cleanser to tide me over for 4 days and my face was not thrilled with me by the time I returned home as was evident by the blemishes that had cropped up. It is a little pricey but you use so little I literally only have to buy 3 tubes or so per year so it works out. My previous cleansers were AMOREPACIFIC and Dermologica. I think this Shiseido cleanser is much better than both of those and have no intention of changing to anything else in the near future because it doesn�t just meet my expectations, it exceeds them.

Because unless there�s some top secret ingredient in there, in all honesty there�s nothing exceptional or different from cheaper options that sets this apartbor makes it worth the $285 that I paid.

Truth be told, there isn�t a great deal in this tissue mask, the ingredients listing is quite basic. You have Pitera (obviously) and only a couple of brightening agents (Niacinamide and Vitamin C - which are in every other brightening mask I�ve used) but for some reason it�s like the perfect storm! Just the right quantity and combination of ingredients for something exceptional. As with all tissue masks, I find these fiddly and end up cutting a line between the mouth and eye slits (both sides) so that the mask can adhere to the sides of my nose and cheeks instead of hanging over them. I leave on for up to 30 minutes and then massage in any excess into my face, neck, arms etc. Pricey - yes, but for me; very much worth it as an occasional splurge. It reduces the sallowness that my skin is prone to and leaves my overall tone brighter and more luminous.

I�ve used SK-II since I was in my teens, and since that time, generally have not felt a need to stray from the brand. However, they discontinued my go-to Derm Brightener moisturizer a couple of years ago. Since then, I�ve experimented with a lot of different moisturizers and avoided purchasing this one because of the extremely high price point. Throughout my travels with a lot of the �trendy� brands these days, such as Tatcha, Fresh, Biossance, Caudalie etc., I was still dissatisfied with my main moisturizer � Tatcha especially left me scratching my head with the texture and the fact that it made me constantly break out. Biossance, I will admit, has moisturizers that �feel� nice, but don�t seem to actually improve my skin. After a year of breakouts, I caved and bought the Ultimate Revival cream. It looked like the closest SK-II product to the Derm Brightener albeit twice the price. And boy am I happy I made that choice! My skin started to get back to its glowing self within a few days.

Despite it being �greasy� upon first application, what I�ve noticed with the SK-II thick creams is that once your skin adapts to them after a couple of weeks, it loses that initial greasy feeling and instead sinks in and leaves it feeling soft and luxurious. I do have oily skin but this has not ever caused me to break out or become oilier. I only use this as a night cream due to its occlusive texture (the ingredients don�t seem to confirm that it is in fact an occlusive but it definitely has that texture, might be just a heavier emollient). And for the price, I�m not even halfway through the jar and it�s been four months since I purchased, so it�s turning out to be decent value. A little goes a long way for this moisturizer too. My only possibly negative note is that it does have a distinct rosy fragrance which is pleasant enough but not really my preferred fragrance.",Incredible occlusive moisturizer,mediumTan,brown,combination,brown

Last year, I took advantage of the 20% off discount and bought the Ultimate. I won�t go back. Though expensive, it truly evens out the fine lines, pores, and texture of the skin over time. You will not notice an immediate effect. But, after 1-2 months, you�ll begin to see a real change in the smoothness of your facial skin. Your skin will become noticeably softer.Hint; get a 1 or 2 ounce eyedropper bottle and pour the product into it. It lasts much longer and keeps the remainder fresh.

PLEASE CONTINUE TO CARRY THIS KIT SEPHORA! It makes getting the products cheap and accessible. When you�ve used self-tanner a long time you learn that there are a few things you have to do to prep your skin for self tanner� Exfoliate and hydrate the areas you�re going to fan for a few days before you do the self tanning.

That isn�t the fault of the product since there is no product that will work optimally if you don�t prep your skin before you self tan.

I waited 5 minutes for the product to dry and put on my makeup and went about my day and 4 hours later I had a perfect even all over glow in a beautiful natural golden shade. It�s so much better than a gel product! The mist is so fine that it deposits completing perfectly without blending! No blending whatsoever!!! I couldn�t believe it!

It leaves a beautiful subtle tan for my pale skin. Very subtle and that is the reason why I like this and it stays. I knocked a star off because the texture can be messy-gel like.

On one hand it is the only vitamin C cream I have used that didn�t cause me to break out and it doesn�t oxidize in my pores and cause blackheads. On the other hand it is quite pricey, not overly moisturizing and I didn�t notice any brightening effects in the 3 weeks I have been using it consistently. It is a nice lightweight, non-greasy formula so maybe I will enjoy it more in the summer when my skin tends to be more oily but for the dry winter months it seems an extra, unnecessary step that isn�t doing a whole lot for my skin. The scent is nice and light, citrus plus maybe vanilla (like a creamsicle scent). My skin can be sensitive to harsh ingredients and perfumes but and I didn�t notice any irritation with this serum.

I would caution people to only try a couple times a week, this isn�t a nightly product. I can understand how people would struggle with this. I�d recommend starting with something more gentle if you haven�t used a strong retinoid before! This will take time for your skin to acclimate to. I have not experienced any sensitivity or dryness but I have been using tretinoin every other day for over a year, so my skin is used to it.  The texture of this is beautiful, it looks and feels very similar to a custard like in a fruit tart. The emollient quality feels exceptionally nice applying to the skin, and the applicator feels nice and cool. There�s a bit of thickness to it, like a hybrid between a gel and a cream, but it�s not overly occlusive in a way that would cause milia, in my experience.

When you initially take this out of the package it will have a yellow tube in the middle of the brush holding in the powder. You need to take a pair of tweezers or something to pull it out. Once you pull it out the powder is now loose and you can twist the bottom, holding the brush upside down, and powder will fill the brush. I usually use this for touch ups in the summer. It is definitely not full coverage, just something to slip in the bag and take out for a nice touch of extra SPF. It�s not a powder foundation, nor will it super set your makeup. This is purely for touch ups after applying a good spf before makeup. I personally love it, it�s not messy and the cap holds on in my bag. It�s small enough to take to theme parks in the summer, or out by the beach. If you simply use it for touch ups it will last a very long time, if you are looking for an everyday, heavy duty powder - look for bare minerals or something that has SPF in it with bigger packaging/more coverage.",PLS READ THIS LOL,light,green,normal,brown

But this mask soothes, hydrates, and leaves my skin feeling amazing! This mask goes on smooth and feels gentle and silky. There is no tightening or pulling and my skin feels gentle and plump under this mask. Although it is a small amount- I can�t say enough about how worthwhile this product is. And yes- even for the price tag. My mom sent me this after I moved from the east coast to Colorado. The deadly dry air was troubling my skin and as someone with super sensitive skin and Rosacea, I struggle to keep my skin moisturized because I always have a bad reaction to products - even ones I use daily. Because of this, I am super careful shelling out $$$. This mask has been a godsend. I am truly excited to share this product with friends because I�m 29, and I�ve always looked young- but the dry air was making my skin age quickly. This is the secret we have all been looking for!

Decided to try this Micellar cleanser on a whim and oh boy it did not disappoint! It leaves my skin very soft and never dry, washes off makeup beautifully and never irritates the skin. Also much cheaper than Bader (and even less drying). It�s even cheaper if you buy refills from the official store.

I honestly hadn�t look at the price until they charged me, it is quite expensive- $42 ??. I would say that it�s worth the splurge! I have dry skin and I use this both in AM & PM routine or whenever I feel my skin needs to re moisturize. I do feel like it moisturizes my skin for a good couple of hours before I need to spray again. The main reason why I would purchase this again is bc I have noticed a difference in my skin tone! I do have an uneven skin tone and get redness on cheeks and I feel like that has improved. I didn�t even know this spray helped w/ that until I looked it up.
